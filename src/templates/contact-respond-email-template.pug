            p Hey there 👋
            p I’m Eromosele Akhigbe, Co-founder and COO of LuxNet. I’m really excited to welcome you to the waitlist for our first product, Verrify.
            p Why Verrify?
            p If you’ve ever tried to verify land ownership in Nigeria, you already know the headache. Confusing records, missing data, slow processes. It’s a problem that has stuck around for far too long.
            p We’re here to fix that.
            p Verrify is built to make land ownership verification as easy as searching for a location on Google Maps.
            p With just a few clicks, you’ll be able to find out exactly who owns what and where.
            p We’re working hard behind the scenes and can’t wait to show you what we’ve been building. You’ll be one of the first to know when we go live, and we think you’ll love what’s coming.
            p In the meantime, feel free to reply if you have questions or just want to say hi.
            p Thanks again for signing up.
            p Let’s make land verification simpler, together.
